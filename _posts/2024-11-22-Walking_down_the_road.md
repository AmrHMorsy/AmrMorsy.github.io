### Walking down the road, 

Walking down the road, <br>
Itâ€™s foggy and dim. <br>
No compass for directions, <br>
No destination on the horizon. <br>

Walking down the road, <br>
The Path behind me crumbles. <br>
The Path ahead of me is blurry. <br>
So no choice but to keep, <br>
walking down the road. <br>

    </div>
