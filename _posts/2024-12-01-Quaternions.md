### **Introduction** <br>
<br> 

In computer graphics, rotations are commonly represented using matrices. For example, a rotation by an angle $$\theta$$ around the axis $$A$$ is expressed using the following matrix


\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta + (1 - \cos \theta) A_x^2  & (1 - \cos \theta) A_x A_y - \sin \theta A_z & (1- \cos \theta) A_x A_z + \sin \theta A_y \cr
(1 - \cos \theta)A_x A_y + \sin \theta A_z & \cos \theta + (1 - \cos \theta) A_y^2  & (1- \cos \theta) A_y A_z - \sin \theta A_x \cr
(1 - \cos \theta)A_x A_z - \sin \theta A_y & (1 - \cos \theta) A_y A_z + \sin \theta A_x & \cos \theta + ( 1 - \cos \theta ) A_z^2
\end{bmatrix}

Applying this rotation to a vertex is as simple as multiplying the vertex by the matrix.

However, matrices are not the only way to represent rotations. There is a better alternative: **Quaternions**.

In this post, weâ€™ll dive deep into quaternions.

We will explore their mathematical foundations, their use in representing rotations, and how they can be more easily interpolated to produce smooth animations.
