### Walking down the road, 

Walking down the road, 
Itâ€™s foggy and dim. 
No compass for directions, 
No destination on the horizon. 

Walking down the road, 
The Path behind me crumbles. 
The Path ahead of me is blurry. 
So no choice but to keep, 
walking down the road.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
