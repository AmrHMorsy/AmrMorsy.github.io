### **Introduction** <br>
<br> 

In computer graphics, rotations are commonly represented using matrices. For example, a rotation by an angle $$\theta$$ around the axis $$A$$ is expressed using the following matrix

\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}

Applying this rotation to a vertex is as simple as multiplying the vertex by the matrix.

However, matrices are not the only way to represent rotations. There is a better alternative: **Quaternions**.

In this post, weâ€™ll dive deep into quaternions.

We will explore their mathematical foundations, their use in representing rotations, and how they can be more easily interpolated to produce smooth animations.
