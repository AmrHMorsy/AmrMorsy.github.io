I am excited to announce that I have completed the Procedural Terrain Generation project, and is relased on [github](https://github.com/AmrHMorsy/Procedural-Terrain-Generation-OpenGL). Feel free to check it out. Later this week, I will release a blog post explaining my development process and will share tutorials and explanations of topics like Perlin Noise, fBM, LOD, PBR, IBL, Frutsum Culling, Texture Baking, Volumetric Fog Rendering and more. Stay tuned !
