Welcome ! <br>
<br>
My name is Amr Morsy, and I am a graphics programmer. 


This website is a space where I showcase my graphics programming projects, including video games, simulations, and game engines. I also share tutorials and explanations of advanced graphics programming concepts through my blog and YouTube channel, and offer personal insights, detailing my experiences and development journey.


I work with low-level graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D, and DirectX, as I prefer programming at a low level for greater control and optimization.


I hope this website inspires and benefits you in your own graphics programming journey.
